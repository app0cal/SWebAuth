  <h1>Week 28 - The stuffed retiring</h1>

  <h2>Preface – Why I track</h2>
  <p>
    I started recording what I throw away each week because I realized I don’t notice the moment most objects “end.”
    To elaborate, the meaning behind items don’t disappear when they stop being useful, rather they get pushed back into spots that are forgotten,
    gaining dust on them. Sometimes an item is left sitting with no use and it’s done to the point where you even forget its place.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is documenting my own experience of discarding and how I want to see my things “end”.
    Rather than just discarding my items I use the weekly descriptions as records to keep information about the project,
    without needing picture perfect measurements or notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s more of a weekly inventory of small decisions: what I keep, what I replace, and what I hold onto for reasons that aren’t practical.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creating this miniature blog is another reason why I enjoy sharing it. Knowing that someone might come across the way I discard my items
    and give them what I consider a proper end might encourage them to do the same for objects that don’t deserve to end up in some forgotten corner of a room.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview – Patterns I noticed</h2>
  <p>
    This week of discarding felt like a continuation of the same problem I wrote about in the Preface: objects don’t really “end”
    when they stop being useful. They end when I finally notice them again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of what I got rid of this week wasn’t sudden trash, it was stuff that had been pushed back, left sitting, and slowly turned into background clutter.
    When I looked at everything together, it didn’t feel random. It felt like proof that I keep items longer than I realize, mostly because it’s easy to forget them.
  </p>
  <p>
    What stood out to me is that disposal is rarely one clean decision. It’s usually a slow process: I stop using something,
    I leave it somewhere “for now,” and then it sits there until I either replace it or get tired of seeing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A large number of objects we “throw out” fall under this umbrella where items exist in a gap where they have meaning,
    then lose it and then are thrown out. This week had a lot of items stuck in that gap.
  </p>
  <p>
    One group of items this week were objects I kept mostly for comfort, decoration, or the vibe they gave off. The dinosaur plushie is a good example:
    it’s easy to keep because it’s cute, but it’s worn and torn now and doesn’t feel worth holding onto.
    The alien dog plush fits into the same category, except it’s also too large, so it takes up space without actually being used.
    The glossy universe-cat print belongs here too. It’s still funny, but it doesn’t match what I want my space to look like anymore,
    which makes it feel like it’s from an older version of my room.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another group this week was made up of things that stopped doing their job. The gym wrist wraps stretched out,
    and once they stopped providing real support, they weren’t useful anymore.
    The broken charger fits here too: it’s the kind of thing you only notice when it fails.
    When something like that stops working, keeping it around doesn’t give it a second life.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last group was made up of items that were finished, replaced, or kept out of habit. The creatine tub is simple, it ran out,
    so the container didn’t have a purpose anymore. The can opener was replaced with a better one, which made the old one unnecessary.
    The empty cologne bottle fits the same pattern: it’s finished and keeping it doesn’t change that.
    The sloth keychain is the most personal example in this group. It used to mean something, but I haven’t used it in a long time and leaving it in a drawer
    felt like the same “pushed back and forgotten” ending that this project is trying to prevent.
  </p>

  <h2>Gallery – The nine items of the week</h2>

  <h3>Dinosaur Plushie Squished</h3>
  <img id="img1" src="img1.jpg" alt="Dinosaur Plushie Squished" />
  <p>Worn and torn now; no longer comforting to keep around.</p>

  <h3>Alien Dog Plush</h3>
  <img id="img2" src="img2.jpg" alt="Alien Dog Plush" />
  <p>Too large for my space; it became storage more than something I enjoyed.</p>

  <img id="img3" src="img3.jpg" alt="Universe Cat Print (Glossy)" />
  <p> Aesthetic phase; doesn’t match what I want displayed anymore.</p>

  <img id="img4" src="img4.jpg" alt="Gymreaper Wrist Wraps" />
  <p>Stretched out; no longer supportive.</p>

  <h3>Empty Creatine Tub</h3>
  <img id="img5" src="img5.jpg" alt="Empty Creatine Tub" />

  <p>Replaced with a better one; redundant.</p>

  <p>Stopped working; no reason to keep it.</p>

  <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
  <p>
    These are just a few quick facts that connect this week’s items to bigger stuff like materials and disposal.
    I’m keeping this part simple so it doesn’t feel like a random info dump.
  </p>

  <h3>Most plushies are stuffed with synthetic filling</h3>
  <p>
    Stuffed animals are commonly filled with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester_fiberfill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polyester fiberfill</a>,
    which is basically synthetic stuffing that can compress over time. Notable, because sometimes the synthetic filling 
	really be recycled like you want it to be. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester_fiberfill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>)
  </p>

  <h3>Chargers are considered e-waste when they’re trashed</h3>
  <p>
    Cables and chargers count as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronic waste</a>
    when you get rid of them, which is why e-waste drop-offs exist in the first place. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>)
  </p>

  <h2>Coda - Final thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    This week felt like clearing out the quiet leftover things I didn’t dislike enough to throw away immediately but also didn’t actively choose to keep.
    Putting them into a single gallery makes it obvious how often “future use” is just a way of postponing a decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next week, I want to pay attention to what gets discarded without any hesitation versus what I keep negotiating with myself about.
    If you’ve been documenting your own weekly clutter or have thoughts about what counts as “waste,” feel free to share them.
